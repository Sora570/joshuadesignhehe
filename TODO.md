# Checkout Error Debugging Plan

## Information Gathered
- The "checkout failed. Please try again" error originates from the inline JavaScript in cashier.html, specifically in the processPayment function's catch block.
- The backend checkout_process.php handles order creation, transaction recording, and inventory deduction.
- Potential issues could be:
  - Missing or invalid cart data structure
  - Database connection issues
  - Inventory stock validation failures
  - Session/user authentication problems
  - JSON parsing errors

## Plan
1. [ ] Add detailed error logging in cashier.html's processPayment function to capture exact error details
2. [ ] Validate cart data structure before sending to backend
3. [ ] Add console logging for request/response details
4. [ ] Test checkout with sample data to reproduce issue
5. [ ] Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Dependent Files
- cashier.html (inline JavaScript modifications)
- db/checkout_process.php (if backend issues found)

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Run tests to verify checkout functionality after changes
- [ ] Check browser console for detailed error messages
- [ ] Monitor database for successful order creation
